    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "As most of the people require review about a product before spending their money on the product. So people come across various reviews in the website but these reviews are genuine or fake is not identified by the user. In some review websites some good reviews are added by the product company people itself in order to make product famous this people belong to Social Media Optimization team. They give good reviews for many different products manufactured by their own firm. User will not be able to find out whether the review is genuine or fake."
